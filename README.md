### Description

Avocado organiser will sort all your files for creation date, then puts them in folders for each file in a year > month > day format.

Packaged and works for Windows and MacOS. This is a desktop app made with Electron.

### Limitations

Operating systems are very particular in what "create date" means. If the file is in the original hard drive it was created then create date is exactly what you would expect, if instead the file was copied from another hard drive or even from the same hard drive the create date will be overriden by the last modified date.
